mapping-regions
===============

Mapping regions is a free to use repository of custom made geo-spatial data for Australian states and territories. The contained regions are not incredibly accurate and are only intended to highlight regions in a nice looking manner for use in map region highlighting. For example instead of using a pin to highlight a statewide service/location, the included regions could be used.
